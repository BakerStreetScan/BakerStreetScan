   python -m venv venv
   ```

2. Activate the virtual environment:

   - On Windows:

     ```shell
     venv\Scripts\activate

     ```shell
     source venv/bin/activate
     ```

## Install Project Dependencies

1. Make sure you are in the project directory and your virtual environment (if used) is activated.

2. Install the project dependencies using `pip` and the `requirements.txt` file:

   ```shell
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
